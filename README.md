# hello-world
This is my first repository. I'm creating this because I want to learn how GitHub works and how to do pull requests. 

I'm Lisp, and Im goin to learn how to use a GitHub and how to make a pull requests because these are very important skills for young programmers. There's no time to waste so I have to go. Bye!
